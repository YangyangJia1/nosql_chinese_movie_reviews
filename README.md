## Introduction

Customerâ€™s opinions have always been an important piece of information in decision making process. We attempt to predict the sentiment polarity of Chinese movie reviews from the web. The reviews are obtained from the IMDB movie website that contains ratings by users for the popular Chinese movies. The movies ranged between years 1971 and 2015. To evaluate our sentiment analysis framework, we use a sentiment analysis software, SentiStrength. SentiStrength estimates the strength of positive and negative sentiments in short texts. SentiStrength reports binary (positive/negative) and trinary (positive/ negative/ neutral) classification results.
